  Agreement for sale of a used car
subquestion: |
   Having a written agreement is a great way to protect yourself when buying a used car. For important context, make sure to read [how to protect yourself when buying a used car](https://www.peopleslawschool.ca/buying-used-car-protect-yourself/) and [closing the sale](https://www.peopleslawschool.ca/buying-used-car-closing-sale/).
   
    In the screens that follow, we’ll ask you a set of questions, and you’ll end up with a draft agreement that suits your needs. If you don’t have the information you need on hand, no worries. You can always edit the agreement afterwards using your word processor of choice.
